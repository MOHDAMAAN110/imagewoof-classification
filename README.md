## 📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases **deep learning on the ImageWoof dataset**, a subset of ImageNet with 10 dog breeds 🐶.  
I trained a custom neural network with:  
- ✅ **Custom DataLoader** written from scratch  
- ✅ **Modified pooling layers** at the end of the network  
- ✅ Training on **Google Colab GPU**  
- ✅ Achieved strong results within just **10 epochs** 🎯  

The work was an **extension of my Imagenette experiment**, proving my ability to adapt the same pipeline to a new dataset.
